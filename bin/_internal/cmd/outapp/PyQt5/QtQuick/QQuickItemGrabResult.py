        types is normally a sequence of individual types.  Each type is either a
        type object or a string that is the name of a C++ type.  Alternatively
        each type could itself be a sequence of types each describing a different
        overloaded signal.
        name is the optional C++ name of the signal.  If it is not specified then
        the name of the class attribute that is bound to the signal is used.
        revision is the optional revision of the signal that is exported to QML.
        If it is not specified then 0 is used.
        arguments is the optional sequence of the names of the signal's arguments.
